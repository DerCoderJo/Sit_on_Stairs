With this Addon named "Sit on Stairs" you can sit on Stairs and if you add other Blocks to the Settings, you can sit on every Block! Without any function like in other Addons, you just need to click on a Stair and you will sit, no other Block that you need to craft, no Texture pack, just a click on a Stair. And you don't need new Blocks or something else, just normal stairs!


If you want to change settings, you need to run the command /function `sitOnStairs/settings`
If you want to reset all, you need to run the command `/function sitOnStairs/reset`

You can use this Addon in your world/realm/server but don't say that you have created it.
